# App

This is an app made as part of a project for the course DV1610 at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola. The purpose of the 
project is to make a system for bike rental. There are three applications that make up the frontend of the project,
and this app is one part  of that. There is also a [webclient for customers](https://github.com/gizmo10475/PatternProject/tree/main/src/frontend/webclientCustomer/webclientCustomer) and a [webclient for admin](https://github.com/gizmo10475/PatternProject/tree/main/src/frontend/webclientAdmin/webclientAdmin).
This app is made for customers.

In this app you can view all bikes and stations on a map. You can also rent a bike and return it.
