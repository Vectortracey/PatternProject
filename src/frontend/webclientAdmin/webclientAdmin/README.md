This is a website made as part of a project for the course DV1610 at Blekinge Tekniska
HÃ¶gskola. The purpose of the project is to make a system for bike rental. There are three
applications that make up the frontend of the project, and this website is one part of that.
There is also a [webclient for customers](https://github.com/gizmo10475/PatternProject/tree/main/src/frontend/webclientCustomer/webclientCustomer)
and an [app for customers](https://github.com/gizmo10475/PatternProject/tree/main/src/frontend/app).
